Revision history for Perl extension POE-Component-Child.

revision 1.31
date: 2003/06/24 19:52:01;  author: ekkis;  state: Exp;  lines: +24 -7
- revamped kil() method to allow sending other signals to children processes.  T
hanks to Mathieu Longtin [perl@closetwork.org] for suggesting this!
- softened default kill() from -9 to TERM

revision 1.30
date: 2003/06/24 18:16:46;  author: ekkis;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -2
- apparently later versions of POE complain about a "deprecation alert" because 
my SIGCHLD handler did not call sig_handled()... so now it does.  Thanks to Math
ieu Longtin [perl@closetwork.org] for bringing that up.

revision 1.29
date: 2003/06/24 02:21:44;  author: ekkis;  state: Exp;  lines: +20 -11
- fixed a reference to "$PKG::$self->{...}" that was getting badly interpreted. 
 Thanks to Mathieu Longtin [perl@closetwork.org] for pointing this out.

date: 2003/06/23 08:40:51;  author: ekkis;  state: Exp;  lines: +56 -23
- fixed CPAN bug # 2720 reported by poe@jbs.t0c.de which showed that ::Child iss
ued C<done> events before receiving the Wheel::Run CloseEvent which caused for l
oss of output data.  after consultation with dngnand, switched to wait for both 
events (sigchld & CloseEvent)
